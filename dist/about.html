                <p>Hi there, thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am a motivated web developer
                    with over two years of professional experience. I am coder by day, and an artist and father by night. 
                    I enjoy taking on complex challenges, and turning them into clean, simple and understandable user experiences.
                    I take pride in the work that I do, and enjoy learning about the different business I create sollutions for. 
                    Please take the time to explore some of the <a href="#"><span class="job-link">projects</span></a> I've worked on. 
                </p>

                <h3>Global Rainbow</h3>
                <h5>Laser Technician</h5>
                <p>The Global Rainbow is an incredible and emotional international art intallation
                made designed and curated by international visual artist 
                <a href="https://www.yvettemattern.com/"><span class="job-link">Yvette Matterm</span></a>. 
                The installation is made from seven highly collimated, low divergence, 
                powerful laser beams. There is identical power in each wavelength band,
                creating a natural, and beautiful rainbow. I am responsibile for the successful 
                technical execution of each job. By installing requisite hardware to service the 
                installation, running the software to calibrate each laser, and maintainimg 
                legacy code, I have succesfully run shows in five countries.</p>

                <h3>Francis Solar</h3>
                <h5>Project Manager</h5>
                <p>I managed a large-scale residential solar operation in Austin, Tx.
                I trained new employees, managed installation crews, coordinated timelines 
                and kept our crew engaged, productive and in high spirits. The technical aspects 
                of the jobs were exciting. I programmed all inverters onsite, ensured elecrical 
                installation was up to company standards, coordinated with local electrical inspector,
                troubleshot all technical issues, documented each step of installation on the cloud, 
                scheduled work flow, and communicated with finance, accounting, and sales to ensure 
                company wide collaboration.

                <h5>Managing Barista</h5>
                <p>Working as a barista has been one of the great joys of my professional life.
                I have learned so many valuable lessons, and gained many lasting friendships 
                through my years working as a barista. Talking with people from all walks of 
                life has led me to appreciate and respect others in more meaningful ways. 
                As a barista, you are trained to modulate your own emotions. I learned to 
                maintain composure, even in the most chaotic moments, to leverage my personality 
                to help others feel welcome, and how to make the best cup of coffee ever. A skill
                that I celebrate every morning.
                </p>
