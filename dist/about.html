                    I am a part of. I am a developer, writer, artist and father. I enjoy taking on difficult challenges 
                    with multiple complexities and finding clean intuitive sollutions. I am passionate about 
                    creating pragmatic and equitable solutions to the enourmously complex issues posed by the climate crisis.

                <!-- <h5>Laser Technician</h5> -->
                <p>
                    Over the years, I have always found some medium or other to play around with. I've worked with sculpture,
                    pottery, drawing, painting, music, and more. It wasnt until I started coding, however, that I began taking 
                    art seriously. I found something beautiful in painting. It alowed me a medium of expression that was completely
                    different then the medium of code, creating balance in my intellectual life. Art allows me to 
                    explore the emotional and intuitive dimensions of my life that would otherwise pass unseen beneath 
                    the field of awareness affording me insight into the seemingly disperate areas of my life.

                <h3>DEVELOPER</h3>
                <!-- <h5>Project Manager</h5> -->
                <p>As a developer, I often find myself in situations where there is no obvious path forward, 
                    and I am made to bring together the disperate requirements of a project to create a simple 
                    and elegant sollution. The proccess often pushes me past my comfort zone, and forces me to 
                    become better then I was yesterday. Having worked professionally in the field these past years
                    has strengthened my character, improved both linear and non-linear thinking, and unexpectedly,
                    I have become a more effective communicator. Check out some of my recent projects on github.

                <h3>WRITER</h3>
                <!-- <h5>Managing Barista</h5> -->
                <p>I strive to write every day. Writing frees the mind to think freely and express the undercurrents
                    of thoughts swimming in the seas of the unconscious. At least I like to think so. I think of language 
                    as a method of making meaning; its like a tool, which we use to string together impressions and feelings
                    into a coherent narrative. With that in mind, writing enables us to untangle this (too often snarled) 
                    web of conflated impressions and create something of value. It is my hope that the writers of the world 
                    can echo this call--each in their own way--and take up pens to creating the stories that will inspire 
                    the world towards wisdom and understanding.
